### What does this do? :hear_no_evil:
This app allows users to scrape the newspaper outlet, The Guardian, and review articles. Scraping allows us to collect all the text that is stored in certain classes and ids and to use them on our website. The articles which appear on the homepage have a button for saving them in a user's "saved articles page". On this page, the articles are saved and the user can go back and review all their saved articles, as well as write notes about them or delete them if they are no longer interested in them. 

## How does it work? 
Go to the home page, select "scrape articles" to see all the articles which appear. Click "save article" on the articles that you'd like to save. Got to "saved articles" on the home page to see all of your saved articles, or "clear articles" to clear the articles which are displayed. 

### About the app: :see_no_evil:

This is the first assignment in the UC Berkeley Coding BootCamp, where I used MongoDB as a database. The goal of this assignment was to practice building databases through MongoDB and accessing them through the server to read & modify them and display their content on a website (delete/modify/add data, etc.). 

### Programs & technology used: :speak_no_evil:

The programing languages I used to build this application are Javascript and JQuery. To allow for Javascript to run in the server, I used Node.js and npm packages such as: 

* inquirer 
* mongoose
* express
* cheerio 
* path 
* mongojs
* axios
